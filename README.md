I am a Web Developer and I own a picture of some seagulls

### My Projects

In the past I have worked for the University of South Florida working in VB.net and ASP.net.

After that I was working for a Startup developing an application for field engineers using Angular 1 and NodeJS.

Currently I am working independently accepting jobs doing web development, search engine optimization, and a third thing.

I made this web site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), written in markdown (seen below) rather than HTML and CSS.

This is all placeholder content.

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```
